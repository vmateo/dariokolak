            The life of the shinobi is beginning to change. Boruto Uzumaki, son
            of Seventh Hokage Naruto Uzumaki, has enrolled in the Ninja Academy
            to learn the ways of the ninja. Now, as a series of
            <em>mysterious</em> events unfolds, Boruto‚Äôs story is about to
            begin!
          </p>

          <p>
            In this post, let's dive deep into the Boruto anime. We will learn
            what the anime Boruto is all about, and why you too should watch it.
          </p>

          <h3>Who is Boruto?</h3>
          <p>
            Boruto is the first child of Naruto and Hinata Uzumaki, receiving a
            younger sister Himawari two years later. As his parents continued to
            stay close to their childhood friends over the years, Boruto
            ultimately came to know the various parents' respective kids well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stemming from his two strong bloodlines, Boruto is a prodigy,
            regarded as able to accomplish anything he attempts in remarkably
            short periods of time. Having inherited his paternal grandfather's
            genius and his father's unpredictability, he scored at the top of
            his class and by his Genin Exams, and is viewed as well-above the
            rest of his generation with ch≈´nin-level prowess
          </p>
          <p>Borutos main battle advantage is :</p>
